Hello! This is my *WORK IN PROGRESS* personal project "Crochet App" (name also in progress).

This is an application that is built primarily for mobile use, made in inspiration for my avid crocheter girlfriend, as well as an excuse to learn React Native!

The app will allow the user to easily create and share crochet patterns. Due to the striking variance in abbreviations/terminology of common stitch types by region and preference, this app will automatically localize abbreviations according to user preference, so users will never be confused by complicated terminology.
(ex: did you know that single crochet 'sc' in the US is referred to as double crochet 'dc' in the UK? How confusing!)

The app will also include features to help ease the crochet process, such as markable progress by collapsing completed sections, stitch and round/row counters, and more to come!

Note: This app is not currently listed on any app stores, and once a stable version is created it will be demo-able on React Native expo go. Until then, feel free to check in on my progress :)
